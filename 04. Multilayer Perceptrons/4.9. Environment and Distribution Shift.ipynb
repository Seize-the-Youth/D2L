    "# 4.9. Environment and Distribution Shift\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we worked through a number of hands-on applications of machine learning, fitting models to a variety of datasets. And yet, we never stopped to contemplate either where data come from in the first place or what we plan to ultimately do with the outputs from our models. Too often, machine learning developers in possession of data rush to develop models without pausing to consider these fundamental issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many failed machine learning deployments can be traced back to this pattern. Sometimes models appear to perform marvelously as measured by test set accuracy but fail catastrophically in deployment when the distribution of data suddenly shifts. More insidiously, sometimes the very deployment of a model can be the catalyst that perturbs the data distribution. Say, for example, that we trained a model to predict who will repay vs. default on a loan, finding that an applicant’s choice of footwear was associated with the risk of default (Oxfords indicate repayment, sneakers indicate default). We might be inclined to thereafter grant loans to all applicants wearing Oxfords and to deny all applicants wearing sneakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, our ill-considered leap from pattern recognition to decision-making and our failure to critically consider the environment might have disastrous consequences. For starters, as soon as we began making decisions based on footwear, customers would catch on and change their behavior. Before long, all applicants would be wearing Oxfords, without any coinciding improvement in credit-worthiness. Take a minute to digest this because similar issues abound in many applications of machine learning: by introducing our model-based decisions to the environment, we might break the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we cannot possibly give these topics a complete treatment in one section, we aim here to expose some common concerns, and to stimulate the critical thinking required to detect these situations early, mitigate damage, and use machine learning responsibly. Some of the solutions are simple (ask for the “right” data), some are technically difficult (implement a reinforcement learning system), and others require that we step outside the realm of statistical prediction altogether and grapple with difficult philosophical questions concerning the ethical application of algorithms."

    "## 4.9.1. Types of Distribution Shift\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we stick with the passive prediction setting considering the various ways that data distributions might shift and what might be done to salvage model performance. In one classic setup, we assume that our training data were sampled from some distribution  pS(x,y)  but that our test data will consist of unlabeled examples drawn from some different distribution  pT(x,y) . Already, we must confront a sobering reality. Absent any assumptions on how  pS  and  pT  relate to each other, learning a robust classifier is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a binary classification problem, where we wish to distinguish between dogs and cats. If the distribution can shift in arbitrary ways, then our setup permits the pathological case in which the distribution over inputs remains constant:  pS(x)=pT(x) , but the labels are all flipped:  pS(y|x)=1−pT(y|x) . In other words, if God can suddenly decide that in the future all “cats” are now dogs and what we previously called “dogs” are now cats—without any change in the distribution of inputs  p(x) , then we cannot possibly distinguish this setting from one in which the distribution did not change at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, under some restricted assumptions on the ways our data might change in the future, principled algorithms can detect shift and sometimes even adapt on the fly, improving on the accuracy of the original classifier."

    "### 4.9.1.1. Covariate Shift\n",
    "\n",
    "Among categories of distribution shift, covariate shift may be the most widely studied. Here, we assume that while the distribution of inputs may change over time, the labeling function, i.e., the conditional distribution  P(y∣x)  does not change. Statisticians call this covariate shift because the problem arises due to a shift in the distribution of the covariates (features). While we can sometimes reason about distribution shift without invoking causality, we note that covariate shift is the natural assumption to invoke in settings where we believe that  x  causes  y .\n",

    "\n",
    "Label shift describes the converse problem. Here, we assume that the label marginal  P(y)  can change but the class-conditional distribution  P(x∣y)  remains fixed across domains. Label shift is a reasonable assumption to make when we believe that  y  causes  x . For example, we may want to predict diagnoses given their symptoms (or other manifestations), even as the relative prevalence of diagnoses are changing over time. Label shift is the appropriate assumption here because diseases cause symptoms. In some degenerate cases the label shift and covariate shift assumptions can hold simultaneously. For example, when the label is deterministic, the covariate shift assumption will be satisfied, even when  y  causes  x . Interestingly, in these cases, it is often advantageous to work with methods that flow from the label shift assumption. That is because these methods tend to involve manipulating objects that look like labels (often low-dimensional), as opposed to objects that look like inputs, which tend to be high-dimensional in deep learning."

    "We may also encounter the related problem of concept shift, which arises when the very definitions of labels can change. This sounds weird—a cat is a cat, no? However, other categories are subject to changes in usage over time. Diagnostic criteria for mental illness, what passes for fashionable, and job titles, are all subject to considerable amounts of concept shift. It turns out that if we navigate around the United States, shifting the source of our data by geography, we will find considerable concept shift regarding the distribution of names for soft drinks as shown in Fig. 4.9.3.\n",

    "If we were to build a machine translation system, the distribution  P(y∣x)  might be different depending on our location. This problem can be tricky to spot. We might hope to exploit knowledge that shift only takes place gradually either in a temporal or geographic sense."

    "\n",
    "The distributions that gave rise to the training data and those you will encounter in the wild might differ considerably. This happened to an unfortunate startup that some of us (authors) worked with years ago. They were developing a blood test for a disease that predominantly affects older men and hoped to study it using blood samples that they had collected from patients. However, it is considerably more difficult to obtain blood samples from healthy men than sick patients already in the system. To compensate, the startup solicited blood donations from students on a university campus to serve as healthy controls in developing their test. Then they asked whether we could help them to build a classifier for detecting the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we explained to them, it would indeed be easy to distinguish between the healthy and sick cohorts with near-perfect accuracy. However, that is because the test subjects differed in age, hormone levels, physical activity, diet, alcohol consumption, and many more factors unrelated to the disease. This was unlikely to be the case with real patients. Due to their sampling procedure, we could expect to encounter extreme covariate shift. Moreover, this case was unlikely to be correctable via conventional methods. In short, they wasted a significant sum of money."

Since real annotated data are expensive to get, they had the (smart and questionable) idea to use synthetic data from a game rendering engine as additional training data. This worked really well on “test data” drawn from the rendering engine. Alas, inside a real car it was a disaster. As it turned out, the roadside had been rendered with a very simplistic texture. More importantly, all the roadside had been rendered with the same texture and the roadside detector learned about this “feature” very quickly.\n",

Fortunately, in practice, such extreme shifts are rare. Instead, what usually happens is that the task keeps on changing slowly. To make things more concrete, here are some examples:\n",

For instance, we might train a cat detector based on lots of pictures of cats and dogs. Once we trained it, we ship it as part of a smart catdoor computer vision system that lets only cats in. This is then installed in a customer’s home and is never updated again (barring extreme circumstances)."

Many real problems fall into this category. For example, we need to predict tomorrow’s stock price, this allows us to trade based on that estimate and at the end of the day we find out whether our estimate allowed us to make a profit.

Likewise, a user’s behavior on a news site will depend on what we showed him previously (e.g., he will read most news only once). Many such algorithms form a model of the environment in which they act such as to make their decisions appear less random. Recently, control theory (e.g., PID variants) has also been used to automatically tune hyperparameters to achive better disentangling and reconstruction quality, and improve the diversity of generated text and the reconstruction quality of generated images [Shao et al., 2020]."

    "One key distinction between the different situations above is that the same strategy that might have worked throughout in the case of a stationary environment, might not work throughout when the environment can adapt. For instance, an arbitrage opportunity discovered by a trader is likely to disappear once he starts exploiting it. The speed and manner at which the environment changes determines to a large extent the type of algorithms that we can bring to bear. For instance, if we know that things may only change slowly, we can force any estimate to change only slowly, too. If we know that the environment might change instantaneously, but only very infrequently, we can make allowances for that. These types of knowledge are crucial for the aspiring data scientist to deal with concept shift, i.e., when the problem that he is trying to solve changes over time."

    "## 4.9.5. Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning\n",
    "Finally, it is important to remember that when you deploy machine learning systems you are not merely optimizing a predictive model—you are typically providing a tool that will be used to (partially or fully) automate decisions. These technical systems can impact the lives of individuals subject to the resulting decisions. The leap from considering predictions to decisions raises not only new technical questions, but also a slew of ethical questions that must be carefully considered. If we are deploying a medical diagnostic system, we need to know for which populations it may work and which it may not. Overlooking foreseeable risks to the welfare of a subpopulation could cause us to administer inferior care. Moreover, once we contemplate decision-making systems, we must step back and reconsider how we evaluate our technology. Among other consequences of this change of scope, we will find that accuracy is seldom the right measure. For instance, when translating predictions into actions, we will often want to take into account the potential cost sensitivity of erring in various ways. If one way of misclassifying an image could be perceived as a racial sleight of hand, while misclassification to a different category would be harmless, then we might want to adjust our thresholds accordingly, accounting for societal values in designing the decision-making protocol. We also want to be careful about how prediction systems can lead to feedback loops. For example, consider predictive policing systems, which allocate patrol officers to areas with high forecasted crime. It is easy to see how a worrying pattern can emerge:\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighborhoods with more crime get more patrols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, more crimes are discovered in these neighborhoods, entering the training data available for future iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exposed to more positives, the model predicts yet more crime in these neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next iteration, the updated model targets the same neighborhood even more heavily leading to yet more crimes discovered, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the various mechanisms by which a model’s predictions become coupled to its training data are unaccounted for in the modeling process. This can lead to what researchers call runaway feedback loops. Additionally, we want to be careful about whether we are addressing the right problem in the first place. Predictive algorithms now play an outsize role in mediating the dissemination of information. Should the news that an individual encounters be determined by the set of Facebook pages they have Liked? These are just a few among the many pressing ethical dilemmas that you might encounter in a career in machine learning."
