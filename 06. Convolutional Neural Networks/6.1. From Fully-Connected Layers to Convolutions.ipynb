    "Translation invariance in images implies that all patches of an image will be treated in the same manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Locality means that only a small neighborhood of pixels will be used to compute the corresponding hidden representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In image processing, convolutional layers typically require many fewer parameters than fully-connected layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNS are a special family of neural networks that contain convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Channels on input and output allow our model to capture multiple aspects of an image at each spatial location."
