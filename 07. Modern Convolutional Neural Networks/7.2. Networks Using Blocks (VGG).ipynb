    "# 7.2. Networks Using Blocks (VGG)\n",
    "\n",
    "While AlexNet offered empirical evidence that deep CNNs can achieve good results, it did not provide a general template to guide subsequent researchers in designing new networks. In the following sections, we will introduce several heuristic concepts commonly used to design deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Progress in this field mirrors that in chip design where engineers went from placing transistors to logical elements to logic blocks. Similarly, the design of neural network architectures had grown progressively more abstract, with researchers moving from thinking in terms of individual neurons to whole layers, and now to blocks, repeating patterns of layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of using blocks first emerged from the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at Oxford University, in their eponymously-named VGG network. It is easy to implement these repeated structures in code with any modern deep learning framework by using loops and subroutines."
